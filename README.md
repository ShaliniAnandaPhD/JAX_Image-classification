# JAX_Image-classification
Exploring JAX for machine learning 

This project demonstrates the application of JAX, a high-performance numerical computing library, in building and training a neural network for image classification. We used the MNIST dataset to train a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model.

## Project Overview

The aim was to explore JAX's capabilities, particularly in areas like automatic differentiation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and vectorization. We went through various stages of a typical machine-learning project:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
2. **Model Building**: Defining a simple MLP architecture suitable for image classification.
3. **Training Loop**: Implementing a training loop with gradient computation and JIT compilation.
4. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model and evaluating its performance.
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the training loss over epochs.

## Learnings and Outcomes

The project provided insights into JAX's core functionalities and how they can be leveraged in a machine-learning context. Key takeaways include:

- **Efficient Gradient Computation**: JAX's automatic differentiation is effective for computing gradients, which is crucial for training neural networks.
- **Performance Boost with JIT Compilation**: The JIT compilation feature in JAX significantly speeds up operations, especially in the training loop.
- **Handling of Matrix Operations**: JAX's handling of matrix operations and vectorization is intuitive and efficient, aligning well with typical machine learning workflows.

## Evaluation of JAX for Machine Learning

### Pros:
- **Performance**: JAX's JIT compilation and efficient execution of array operations make it highly performant, especially for tasks involving large-scale numerical computations.
- **Flexibility in Gradient Computation**: JAX provides fine-grained control over gradient computation, which is beneficial for complex models.
- **Ease of Integration**: It integrates well with other Python libraries, facilitating data handling and preprocessing.

### Cons:
- **Learning Curve**: For those accustomed to high-level APIs like Keras, JAX's low-level approach can present a steeper learning curve.
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Due to JIT compilation, debugging JAX code can be more challenging compared to more straightforward Python code.
- **Ecosystem and Community Support**: As a relatively new library, JAX's ecosystem and community support are still growing, unlike more established libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Conclusion

JAX proves to be a powerful tool for machine learning, especially for projects where performance and fine control over numerical computations are paramount. While its low-level nature and relatively new presence in the field pose certain challenges, its strengths in performance and flexibility make it a promising choice for advanced machine learning practitioners and projects requiring high computational efficiency.
